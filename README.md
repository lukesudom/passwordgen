# passwordgen

Password generator made from HTML, CSS & JS code.

Instructions - click generate password and follow the prompts - making sure to atleast enter one of the values to return a password. 
It is recommended to select all 4 prompts to create the most secure password possible.

Throughout the testing stage i had some issues with creating the if statements which i needed help for in tutor sessions and from youtube. 

There will also be a copy feature added to this generator as soon as i find time to add one. Since the required specifications didnt outline that it needed one
i decided i would submit this version and update later for a portfolio addition.

You can see below a fully generated 128 character password with upper, lower, special and numerical characters.
